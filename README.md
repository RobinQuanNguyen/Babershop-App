# Babershop-App
This is an app that I completed in the Basics of database systems course.

The app uses a simple interface, connecting to the database for comparison every time a customer wants to check if that barber is available at that hour.

Besides, users can also make an appointment with the designated barber (there are many barbers in one store), adjust the appointment schedule as well as cancel the appointment if desired.

However, due to time limits, the app also has certain errors such as if the worker is not on a busy schedule, the customer can still make an appointment with that worker even if the worker is on schedule rest period.
